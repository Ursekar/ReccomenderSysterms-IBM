# ReccomenderSysterms-IBM
Built Recco. Sys. for users reading articles in IBM Watson Studio Platform.
Introduction
For this project you will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles you think they will like. Below you can see an example of what the dashboard could look like displaying articles on the IBM Watson Platform.  


Though the above dashboard is just showing the newest articles, you could imagine having a recommendation board available here that shows the articles that are most pertinent to a specific user.  

In order to determine which articles to show to each user, you will be performing a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform. You can create your own account to become a part of their community, and get a better understanding of their data by creating an account on the platform here.
